      PERMISSION SETUP TO GRANT ACCESS TO GPIO AND SERIAL PORTS
      =========================================================

If you intend to run the TorBot code as an unprivileged user, you will
have to set some permissions to do so.

First of all, mount all ext* filesystems with the 'user_xattr' mount
option. To do so, change the respective lines in '/etc/fstab' to read:

/dev/mmcblk0p2  /  ext4  defaults,noatime,user_xattr  0  1

Move the file 'udev-rules/99-custom-permissions.rules' from the torbot
source directory to '/etc/udev/rules.d':

$ sudo cp -a udev-rules/99-custom-permissions.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
$ shutdown -r now

Add the user you want to enable to execute the code to the groups 'kmem'
and 'dialout':

$ sudo usermod -a -G kmem,dialout pi

Reboot your RaspberryPI

$ sudo shutdown -r now

Log in again and set the capability 'CAP_SYS_RAWIO' on the Python2.7
executable:

$ sudo setcap cap_sys_rawio=pie /usr/bin/python2.7

Now you should be able to run

$ python2 test/test.py

while being logged in as the above user.
