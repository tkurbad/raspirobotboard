            Modifications made to the RaspiRobotBoard
            =========================================

1) To get the odometers to work, the pull-up resistors R3 and R4 (both
    1k) have to be removed.

2) To be able to feed more power (up to 2A instead of 1A) to the
    RaspberryPI, replace the LM2940 voltage regulator with the more
    powerful, pin-compatible L78S05CV.
